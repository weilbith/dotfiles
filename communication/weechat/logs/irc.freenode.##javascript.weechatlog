2018-02-16 20:49:28	ecmabot	thelostfaith: ECMAScript's Array contains a number of built-in methods for iteration (e.g., map, reduce, every, some, filter, and forEach). They relieve the need for manual iteration, provide better abstraction than a `for` loop, and make it clear what your iteration is doing.

2018-02-16 20:50:32	K__L	Alright, this is kind of a bigger fiddle but should suffice to explain. So each event gets classes tacked onto it. the only event right now that has classes is "8 presents". Which means, when clicking either the checkbox for "FR", "Sales-Hub" or "Video-training", it should show this and hide the event that says "New Event". But right now, it hides them both.
