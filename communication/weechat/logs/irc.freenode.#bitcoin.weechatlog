2018-02-16 19:39:00	mtn_	Quick bitcoin question (newbie)! Wallets are just a concept (grouping of addresses), and we can't figure out wallet just by looking at the blockchain itself, right? The blockchain just gives us a set of transactions from sets of input addresses to sets of outputs addresses, but many addresses will be single-use, and we can't do any sort of tracking of wallet balance through time, right?
2018-02-16 19:39:28	cberg	pretty much

2018-02-16 19:40:21	cberg	there are some blockchain analysis tools that try to make guesses about which wallets belong to the same wallet though
2018-02-16 19:40:28	cberg	but that's just that, guessing
2018-02-16 19:41:10	cberg	only when you combine multiple outputs in a single transaction it becomes obvious that they belong to the same wallet
