2018-02-16 20:54:39	panther_	Good afternoon. I have a question regarding default inside map. Is it possible to make a conditional statement for default? Here's what I want to do. How can do an if statement like this default "if dev, use A, if stage use B, if prod use C";
2018-02-16 20:55:30	panther_	I'm sorry, I just figured I can do 2 maps
