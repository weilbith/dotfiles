2018-02-16 20:44:57	phogg	there's a small per-file overhead plus an overhead for the filesystem itself plus an overhead based on the size of the partition

2018-02-16 20:46:27	phogg	most filesystems have a minimum block size so e.g. if it's 4KiB any file under that size still consumes 4KiB of space in the filesystem structure. That minimum allocation size, and whether you can sometimes pack multiple files in to one block or not, also contributes to actual space required by a file
