2018-02-16 20:23:12	tobiasvl	so the hg repo has a commit of the same size, which pushed fine to bitbucket, but git is failing to push a similar (identical?) commit, also to bitbucket?

2018-02-16 20:36:05	zarzar	tobiasvl: that sounds very advanced, perhaps only rarely needed feature, seems like git is never assuming anything even if it the 99% likely case
2018-02-16 20:36:36	eindoofus	grawity, not sure what authorship date is but i believe i'm looking for the commit date. sounds like it'd be both for a new file?
2018-02-16 20:36:48	eindoofus	commiter* date
2018-02-16 20:37:04	tobiasvl	zarzar: yes, that is an accurate assessment. git rarely assumes anything. however, there is a lot of default behavior. so "git push" will not assume you want to set up tracking, but it will push to a default remote (origin) if you don't specify one, for example.
