# Introduction
This repository contains my private dotfiles, to configure different applications.
The version managament with an origin is used as backup mechanism, distribution on different devices and sharing.
Notes here are not meant to give a complete instruction for everyone. Issues will be ignored.
If you should find something particular, feel free to use it by your own. But do not expect any help.

# Dotfiler
The _dotfiler_ is fancy tool I wrote on my own to work with dotfiles in a repository.
Take a look [here](https://github.com/weilbith/dotfiler) if you are interested.
